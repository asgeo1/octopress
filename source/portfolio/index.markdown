Examples of work I have done for my clients

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2017-2018:

### Algorithmic Forex Trading System

I built an algorithmic trading system for a client, which trades forex pairs
continuously whenever the market is open.

The program runs 24x7 on a server, and makes it's trades via a broker, using the
broker's <strong>protocol buffer</strong> API.

The algorithm itself was designed by the client, but which I implemented in <strong>C++</strong>,
as it needed to be as fast as possible in the decisions it makes.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" src="/assets/images/forex-program2.jpg">
</div>

I made the program run as a service, and created a separate web UI for it using
<strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, so the client could review
the program's progress, make live adjustments to the algorithm parameters.
It communicates to the service layer via websockets.

It also featured SMS alerting using the <strong>Twillio API</strong> to alert
for certain price events, and also features interactive graphs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2017-2018:

### Mau - eCommerce mobile shopping app

I built a mobile shopping app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mau/id1327588128?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Mau</a>,
which interfaces with my client's backend ordering & inventory system. (which I
had also custom built for them in the past)

This is a private shopping app - so it's only accessible by the customers of my
client.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/mau-products-list-2.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/mau-products-list-1.jpg">
</div>

This app has the ability to hook into multiple inventory systems, and so it's
not tied to just one - you can actually power a number of eCommerce stores with
it, allowing end-users to switch between stores.

This app was built in <strong>React Native</strong> and uses the <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a>
framework. I also created the API to the backend systems using Ruby on Rails,
and a system for inviting customers to use the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2018:

### Sidekicker mobile application

I've been working on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sidekicker/id1031252842?mt=8">Sidekicker mobile app</a>
for a few years now.

I was not the original developer - the initial version was done in-house. But
since then I've been contracted to work on the app, and have released nearly 20
updates to the app over the last couple of years - each update adding new
features, fixing issue etc.

Along the way I have also improved the codebase, upgrading it to newer framework
versions and build tools.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/sidekicker-joblist.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/sidekicker-jobdetail.jpg">
</div>

The app is using <strong>Ionic Framework</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>,
<strong>Cordova</strong>, <strong>webpack</strong> and various Cordova plugins,
some of which I wrote from scratch myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2017:

### Bluey Travel website rebuild

I rebuilt the <a href="http://www.blueytravel.com.au/">Bluey Travel</a> website,
using a *modern Wordpress stack* and best practices, by utilising the
<a href="https://roots.io">Roots.io</a> stack.

That's right, Wordpress development and hosting doesn't need to be the Wild
Wild West of website development.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="425" src="/assets/images/bluey-travels-rebuild.jpeg">
</div>

My implementation featured best practices for development and deployment,
producing a site that is very easy to update, maintain and support - a big win
for the client, and makes my life a lot easier too :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2017:

### Post Labels Plus

Post Labels Plus, is a bespoke software created for my client, who needed
something to help manage their retail business.

It has features for managing products, sales and inventory, with hooks into eBay
and Australia Post for importing/exporting shipping data, and with a mobile app
on the way!

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="406" src="/assets/images/my-post-labels.jpeg">
</div>

This app is built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>React</strong> frameworks,
which I archetected and developed along with my team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2017:

### LifeAssist Online Needs Assessment Tool

This project was for one of my design agency clients. They did the design work,
and outsourced the programming to me.

This is an online questionaire to assist people with working out what aged care
support they may be entitled to.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="465" height="293" src="/assets/images/life-assist-online-needs.jpg">
</div>

It's live on the lifeAssist website here:
<a href="http://calculator.lifeassist.org.au">Online Needs Assessment Calculator</a>.

This project is a pure Javascript app! Built using <strong>React</strong>, and
using <strong>ES6</strong>, <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>npm</strong> etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016:

### Woodlea Digital Screens

Woodlea is a new suburb being built in the north west of Melbourne.

I was hired as a subcontractor to develop some interactive touch-screen
software, to help show-off Woodlea to potential buyers.

There were two digital screen applications built, one running on a 1080p TV,
and another running on a 4K TV - both connected to PC hardware running Windows
10. (which has great support for touch)

The 4K project, features a massive map of Woodlea, which the user can touch and
interact with - allowing them to browse the various amenities which will be
built.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="406" src="/assets/images/woodlea-4k-display.jpg">
</div>

The 1080p project, is very similar to a digital brochure in concept - it
operates as an interactive, touch-enabled app.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="491" src="/assets/images/woodlea-1080p-display.jpg">
</div>

Both projects use the same software stack. <strong>AngularJS</strong> was used
as the main framework. <strong>NW.js</strong> was used to package it, and to run
it on the desktop.

The design and concept was done by a 3rd party creative digital company, who I
worked with to implement their design in the software.

I architected the software, and alongside my team, built the project in quite a
short timeframe - as we had to have it ready for Woodlea's opening day, which we
achieved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015 - 2016:
### Survive Drive

<a href="http://www.survivedrive.com">Survive Drive</a> is a driver safety
application, designed to help manage the safety of trucks in the
transport industry.

I'm the lead architect and lead developer for this project, and have taken it
from idea to conception, working closely with my client and their other mobile
developer.

Survive Drive features both a web application, as well as supporting mobile
applications.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="351" src="/assets/images/survivedrive-roster.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="628" src="/assets/images/survivedrive-employee.jpg">
</div>

I built the web application, as well as the API for use with their mobile
clients.

Survive Drive was built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. The project required a number of features to built:

 - Driver / truck management
 - Calendar / scheduling
 - CSV import and background processing
 - Email invitation system
 - Fingerprint recognition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015:

### LinkAssist

<a href="http://www.linkassist.com.au">LinkAssist</a> was a project that I
developed with one of my design agency clients.

I worked as the front-end developer in this project, and did all of the
front-end coding, working closely alongside their in-house developer who was
building the backend.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="895" src="/assets/images/linkassist-home.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="735" src="/assets/images/linkassist-notices.jpg">
</div>

LinkAssist is written using the Ruby on Rails framework, and as the front-end
developer I worked with the <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Coffeescript</strong>,
<strong>ERB</strong> and <strong>Ruby</strong> - implementing a design which was
provided by a 3rd-party design agency.

LinkAssist is designed for people with disabilities, so the front-end required
special consideration so features and content would be as accessible as possible.

The site makes use of the <strong>Bootstrap</strong> framework, particularly the
*grid*, so the site could be built responsively - targeting multiple screen
resolutions, including mobile devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015:

### Fieldfolio Direct

I developed the Fieldfolio Direct portal, as an add-on to their existing product.

<a href="http://www.fieldfolio.com">Fieldfolio</a> is an ordering system originally
for iOS, and I developed Fieldfolio Direct as their web-based client.

Fieldfolio Direct allows users to publish their catalogue to the web, allowing
their customers to order directly online.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="383" src="/assets/images/fieldfolio-direct-grid.png">
</div>

I built it as a component on top of their existing <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>
backend. In the process I updated the base application from Rails 3 to 4,
as well as many other improvements.

The design was done by an in-house designer, who I worked closely with to
implement their design in the app as HTML and CSS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015:

### Ironman 4x4 Website and Content Management System

I was the developer for the <a href="http://www.ironman4x4.com">Ironman 4x4 website</a>,
which I was hired as a subcontractor for one of my design agency clients.

The website was built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, and makes use of the
<a href="http://refinerycms.com">Refinery CMS</a> ruby gem to build out the
<strong>Content Management System</strong> (CMS) component.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="492" src="/assets/images/ironman4x4-homepage.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="492" src="/assets/images/ironman4x4-bullbars.jpg">
</div>

This website required a lot more than just editing pages though - it has many
interesting features which were built specifically to the clients requirements.

I worked closely with the design agency to design and build features such as
<em>fit my 4x4</em> (system for tailoring the products to the visitors vehicle),
<em>online quote</em> and <em>find nearby stores</em> -
which make it easy for visitors browsing the website to find the equipment
they are looking for.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2014:

### Deakin Uni Open Day 2014 AR

A client of mine who specialize in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a>
solutions, engaged me to build the iOS version of the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/deakin-uni-open-day-2014-ar/id893009544?mt=8">Deakin Uni Open Day 2014 AR</a>
app.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="568" src="/assets/images/deakin-ar-explore.jpeg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="568" src="/assets/images/deakin-ar-scan.jpeg">
</div>

The app uses a hybrid approach. Most of the screens were developed in native iOS,
but there was also some use of HTML5 and Javascript to interact with the
<a href="http://www.metaio.com/sdk/">Metaio SDK</a>, which was utilized in
implementing the Augmented Reality features.

The app was successfully used on the Deakin Open Day by students, who used the
AR features to navigate, learn, and enhance their Open Day experience.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2014:

### SageFIELDOPs

A client with an existing web-based product in the safety-permit space, needed
<a href="http://www.sagetechnology.com.au/permit-to-work-software">a mobile client built</a>
for their flagship product.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-list.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-detail.png">
</div>

I worked with the client's development team (as the lead developer on the
project) to build a <strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> application, using
<strong>Ionic Framework</strong> and <strong>AngularJS</strong>.

The goal was to have the application run on both
Android and iOS, so cross-platform HTML5 was a good choice to achieve this.

The app can download and syncronise safety-permits, which the user can read and
then action using their mobile - even when "offline". Data is synced back to the
server via a <strong>.NET JSON API</strong> which I also helped build.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2013:

### ISIS DMS

A client in the transport industry needed a
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/microlistics-dms/id968546592?mt=8">smartphone-based delivery system</a>
built as a compliment to their existing Warehouse Management System.

I was hired as a subcontractor to built the system - building the app in
<strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-load-list.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-drop-detail.png">
</div>

The app captures data for each delivery, including the delivery signature
(<strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>), as well as location tracking - a custom
<strong>Phonegap plugin</strong> I wrote.

I also built the backend DMS system, which includs a <strong>JSON API</strong>
and <strong>Web Portal</strong> for tracking deliveries and viewing the
Proof of Delivery - all developed in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and deployed
on <strong>Heroku</strong>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="582" height="377" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-portal-load-details.png">
</div>

Later, I was engaged to help implement the system for a number of customers,
including building interfaces between DMS and the customer's existing transport
system


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2012:

### ARMS Infoscreens

A different client in the transport industry needed a web-based Customer Portal
built, so management could see KPIs, stats, etc on the current status of their
fleet.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="610" height="380" src="/assets/images/arms-infoscreens-graphs.png">
</div>

I was hired as a subcontractor, and built a Web Portal using
<strong>.NET MVC</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

The web portal took data from existing systems (delivery tracking systems,
runsheet management systems) and presented it as viewable information in the
portal - graphs, maps and tabular data were used to show key metrics,
end-customers could also login and view their deliveries, and location of their
truck.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2012:

### Endota Day Spa mobile website

I was hired by a design agency to build the Endota Day Spa mobile website,
working closely with their graphic designers.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-detail.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-booking.png">
</div>

Using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>, I created a mobile website which allows users to
browse and search through Endota's spa locations and view location-specific
services and offers.

Menus for each location can be viewed, as well users can make bookings through
a mobile form.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2011:

### Guitar Charts Creator

I built Guitar Charts Creator for myself, as it was a tool I had been wanting
for a while on my tablet.

GCC is a tool for guitarists, allowing them to create their own chord charts,
designed initially for the iPad and available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id497942050?mt=8">iOS App Store</a>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="468" src="/assets/images/guitar-charts-creator-edit-chart.png">
</div>

I built the app in HTML5 using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

Later, I ported GCC so it could run as a
<a href="http://www.guitarchartscreator.com">stand-alone traditional web app</a>
(via <strong>Heroku</strong>), as well as porting it to <strong>OSX</strong>
via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id689856499?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>
(using <strong>Phonegap</strong>).

All versions of GCC use <strong>Parse.com</strong> as a backend "cloud"
database, allowing user data to be synced between any version of GCC.
