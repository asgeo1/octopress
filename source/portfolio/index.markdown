Examples of work I have done for my clients (not including projects under NDA)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015:

### Fieldfolio Direct

I developed the Fieldfolio Direct portal, as an add-on to their existing product.

<a href="http://www.fieldfolio.com">Fieldfolio</a> is an ordering system originally
for iOS, and I developed Fieldfolio Direct as their web-based client.

Fieldfolio Direct allows users to publish their catalogue to the web, allowing
their customers to order directly online.

</div>

I built it as a component on top of their existing <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>
backend. In the process I updated the base application from Rails 3 to 4,
as well as many other improvements.

The design was done by an in-house designer, who I worked closely with to
implement their design in the app as HTML and CSS.

## 2015:

### Ironman 4x4 Website and Content Management System

I was the developer for the <a href="http://www.ironman4x4.com">Ironman 4x4 website</a>,
which I was hired as a subcontractor for one of my design agency clients.

The website was built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, and makes use of the
<a href="http://refinerycms.com">Refinery CMS</a> ruby gem to build out the
<strong>Content Management System</strong> (CMS) component.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="492" src="/assets/images/ironman4x4-homepage.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="492" src="/assets/images/ironman4x4-bullbars.jpg">
</div>

This website required a lot more than just editing pages though - it has many
interesting features which were built specifically to the clients requirements.

I worked closely with the design agency to design and build features such as
<em>fit my 4x4</em> (system for tailoring the products to the visitors vehicle),
<em>online quote</em> and <em>find nearby stores</em> -
which make it easy for visitors browsing the website to find the equipment
they are looking for.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2014:

### Deakin Uni Open Day 2014 AR

A client of mine who specialize in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality">Augmented Reality</a>
solutions, engaged me to build the iOS version of the
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/deakin-uni-open-day-2014-ar/id893009544?mt=8">Deakin Uni Open Day 2014 AR</a>
app.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="568" src="/assets/images/deakin-ar-explore.jpeg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="568" src="/assets/images/deakin-ar-scan.jpeg">
</div>

The app uses a hybrid approach. Most of the screens were developed in native iOS,
but there was also some use of HTML5 and Javascript to interact with the
<a href="http://www.metaio.com/sdk/">Metaio SDK</a>, which was utilized in
implementing the Augmented Reality features.

The app was successfully used on the Deakin Open Day by students, who used the
AR features to navigate, learn, and enhance their Open Day experience.

## 2014:

### SageFIELDOPs

A client with an existing web-based product in the safety-permit space, needed
a mobile client built for their flagship product.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-list.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-detail.png">
</div>

I worked with the client's development team (as the lead developer on the
project) to build a <strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> application, using
<strong>Ionic Framework</strong> and <strong>AngularJS</strong>.

The goal was to have the application run on both
Android and iOS, so cross-platform HTML5 was a good choice to achieve this.

The app can download and syncronise safety-permits, which the user can read and
then action using their mobile - even when "offline". Data is synced back to the
server via a <strong>.NET JSON API</strong> which I also helped build.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2013:

### ISIS DMS

A client in the transport industry needed a smartphone-based delivery system
built as a compliment to their existing Warehouse Management System.

I was hired as a subcontractor to built the system - building the app in
<strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-load-list.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-drop-detail.png">
</div>

The app captures data for each delivery, including the delivery signature
(<strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>), as well as location tracking - a custom
<strong>Phonegap plugin</strong> I wrote.

I also built the backend DMS system, which includs a <strong>JSON API</strong>
and <strong>Web Portal</strong> for tracking deliveries and viewing the
Proof of Delivery - all developed in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and deployed
on <strong>Heroku</strong>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="582" height="377" src="/assets/images/isis-dms-portal-load-details.png">
</div>

Later, I was engaged to help implement the system for a number of customers,
including building interfaces between DMS and the customer's existing transport
system


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2012:

### ARMS Infoscreens

A different client in the transport industry needed a web-based Customer Portal
built, so management could see KPIs, stats, etc on the current status of their
fleet.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="610" height="380" src="/assets/images/arms-infoscreens-graphs.png">
</div>

I was hired as a subcontractor, and built a Web Portal using
<strong>.NET MVC</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

The web portal took data from existing systems (delivery tracking systems,
runsheet management systems) and presented it as viewable information in the
portal - graphs, maps and tabular data were used to show key metrics,
end-customers could also login and view their deliveries, and location of their
truck.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2012:

### Endota Day Spa mobile website

I was hired by a design agency to build the Endota Day Spa mobile website,
working closely with their graphic designers.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-detail.png">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="548" src="/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-booking.png">
</div>

Using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>, I created a mobile website which allows users to
browse and search through Endota's spa locations and view location-specific
services and offers.

Menus for each location can be viewed, as well users can make bookings through
a mobile form.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2011:

### Guitar Charts Creator

I built Guitar Charts Creator for myself, as it was a tool I had been wanting
for a while on my tablet.

GCC is a tool for guitarists, allowing them to create their own chord charts,
designed initially for the iPad and available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id497942050?mt=8">iOS App Store</a>.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="468" src="/assets/images/guitar-charts-creator-edit-chart.png">
</div>

I built the app in HTML5 using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

Later, I ported GCC so it could run as a
<a href="http://www.guitarchartscreator.com">stand-alone traditional web app</a>
(via <strong>Heroku</strong>), as well as porting it to <strong>OSX</strong>
via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id689856499?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>
(using <strong>Phonegap</strong>).

All versions of GCC use <strong>Parse.com</strong> as a backend "cloud"
database, allowing user data to be synced between any version of GCC.
