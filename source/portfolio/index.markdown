Examples of work I have done for my clients

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2018-2019:

### FSHOP eCommerce System

One of my retail clients wanted a
<a href="https://fshop.com.au">custom-built eCommerce store</a>, that would tie
in with the rest of their systems and publish their products online for
customers to purchase.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" src="/assets/images/fshopcomau-shopfront.jpg">
</div>

Not wanting an off-the-shelf system, I designed and built a custom
eCommerce solution, extending their existing <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>
backend and creating a responsive <strong>React</strong> frontend. The system
utilizing <strong>Stripe</strong> for payments, and <strong>Netlify</strong> for
frontend hosting, including CDN and pre-rending functionality.

The system can actually power a number of eCommerce stores that the client has,
which makes it a lot easier for the client to manage their business.

## 2018-2019:

### Fieldfolio Marketplace

I worked as a backend developer on a small team building
<a href="https://fieldfolio.com">Fieldfolio Marketplace</a> -
an online marketplace for wholesalers to sell direct to their retail customers.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" src="/assets/images/fieldfolio-marketplace.jpg">
</div>

The backend is done in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, and provides REST APIs
for the frontend to consume. The frontend is React and Next.js, which I assisted
the frontend team with in parts, but mostly concentrated on the backend.

Marketplace needed to tie in with the rest of Fieldfolio's applications, so part
of the challange was in designing and architecting something that would work in
conjunction, and then actually building and launching, which we did in 2019.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2017-2018:

### Algorithmic Forex Trading System

I built an algorithmic trading system for a client, which trades forex pairs
continuously whenever the market is open.

The program runs 24x7 on a server, and makes it's trades via a broker, using the
broker's <strong>protocol buffer</strong> API.

The algorithm itself was designed by the client, but which I implemented in <strong>C++</strong>,
as it needed to be as fast as possible in the decisions it makes.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" src="/assets/images/forex-program2.jpg">
</div>

I made the program run as a service, and created a separate web UI for it using
<strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>React</strong>, so the client could review
the program's progress, make live adjustments to the algorithm parameters.
It communicates to the service layer via websockets.

It also featured SMS alerting using the <strong>Twillio API</strong> to alert
for certain price events, and also features interactive graphs.

## 2017-2018:

### Mau - eCommerce mobile shopping app

I built a mobile shopping app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mau/id1327588128?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Mau</a>,
which interfaces with my client's backend ordering & inventory system. (which I
had also custom built for them in the past)

This is a private shopping app - so it's only accessible by the customers of my
client.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/mau-products-list-2.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/mau-products-list-1.jpg">
</div>

This app has the ability to hook into multiple inventory systems, and so it's
not tied to just one - you can actually power a number of eCommerce stores with
it, allowing end-users to switch between stores.

This app was built in <strong>React Native</strong> and uses the <a href="https://expo.io">Expo</a>
framework. I also created the API to the backend systems using
<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, and a system for inviting customers to use the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2018:

### Sidekicker mobile application

I've been working on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sidekicker/id1031252842?mt=8">Sidekicker mobile app</a>
for a few years now.

I was not the original developer - the initial version was done in-house. But
since then I've been contracted to work on the app, and have released nearly 20
updates to the app over the last couple of years - each update adding new
features, fixing issue etc.

Along the way I have also improved the codebase, upgrading it to newer framework
versions and build tools.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/sidekicker-joblist.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" src="/assets/images/sidekicker-jobdetail.jpg">
</div>

The app is using <strong>Ionic Framework</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>,
<strong>Cordova</strong>, <strong>webpack</strong> and various Cordova plugins,
some of which I wrote from scratch myself.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2017:

### Bluey Travel website rebuild

I rebuilt the <a href="http://www.blueytravel.com.au/">Bluey Travel</a> website,
using a *modern Wordpress stack* and best practices, by utilising the
<a href="https://roots.io">Roots.io</a> stack.

That's right, Wordpress development and hosting doesn't need to be the Wild
Wild West of website development.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="425" src="/assets/images/bluey-travels-rebuild.jpeg">
</div>

My implementation featured best practices for development and deployment,
producing a site that is very easy to update, maintain and support - a big win
for the client, and makes my life a lot easier too :-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2017:

### Post Labels Plus

Post Labels Plus, is a bespoke software created for my client, who needed
something to help manage their retail business.

It has features for managing products, sales and inventory, with hooks into eBay
and Australia Post for importing/exporting shipping data, and with a mobile app
on the way!

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="406" src="/assets/images/my-post-labels.jpeg">
</div>

This app is built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>React</strong> frameworks,
which I archetected and developed along with my team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016-2017:

### LifeAssist Online Needs Assessment Tool

This project was for one of my design agency clients. They did the design work,
and outsourced the programming to me.

This is an online questionaire to assist people with working out what aged care
support they may be entitled to.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="465" height="293" src="/assets/images/life-assist-online-needs.jpg">
</div>

It's live on the lifeAssist website here:
<a href="http://calculator.lifeassist.org.au">Online Needs Assessment Calculator</a>.

This project is a pure Javascript app! Built using <strong>React</strong>, and
using <strong>ES6</strong>, <strong>webpack</strong>, <strong>npm</strong> etc.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2016:

### Woodlea Digital Screens

Woodlea is a new suburb being built in the north west of Melbourne.

I was hired as a subcontractor to develop some interactive touch-screen
software, to help show-off Woodlea to potential buyers.

There were two digital screen applications built, one running on a 1080p TV,
and another running on a 4K TV - both connected to PC hardware running Windows
10. (which has great support for touch)

The 4K project, features a massive map of Woodlea, which the user can touch and
interact with - allowing them to browse the various amenities which will be
built.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="406" src="/assets/images/woodlea-4k-display.jpg">
</div>

The 1080p project, is very similar to a digital brochure in concept - it
operates as an interactive, touch-enabled app.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="640" height="491" src="/assets/images/woodlea-1080p-display.jpg">
</div>

Both projects use the same software stack. <strong>AngularJS</strong> was used
as the main framework. <strong>NW.js</strong> was used to package it, and to run
it on the desktop.

The design and concept was done by a 3rd party creative digital company, who I
worked with to implement their design in the software.

I architected the software, and alongside my team, built the project in quite a
short timeframe - as we had to have it ready for Woodlea's opening day, which we
achieved.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2015 - 2016:
### Survive Drive

<a href="http://www.survivedrive.com">Survive Drive</a> is a driver safety
application, designed to help manage the safety of trucks in the
transport industry.

I'm the lead architect and lead developer for this project, and have taken it
from idea to conception, working closely with my client and their other mobile
developer.

Survive Drive features both a web application, as well as supporting mobile
applications.

<div>
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="351" src="/assets/images/survivedrive-roster.jpg">
    <img class="responsive-image" width="320" height="628" src="/assets/images/survivedrive-employee.jpg">
</div>

I built the web application, as well as the API for use with their mobile
clients.

Survive Drive was built using <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and
<strong>PostgreSQL</strong>. The project required a number of features to built:

 - Driver / truck management
 - Calendar / scheduling
 - CSV import and background processing
 - Email invitation system
 - Fingerprint recognition
