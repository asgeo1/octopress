Examples of work I have done for my clients (not including projects under NDA)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2014:

### SageFIELDOPs

A client with an existing web-based product in the safety-permit space, needed
a mobile client built for their flagship product.

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-list.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
</div>

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/sage-fieldops-permit-detail.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

I worked with the client's development team (as the lead developer on the
project) to build a <strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> application, using
<strong>Ionic Framework</strong> and <strong>AngularJS</strong>.

The goal was to have the application run on both
Android and iOS, so cross-platform HTML5 was a good choice to achieve this.

The app can download and syncronise safety-permits, which the user can read and
then action using their mobile - even when "offline". Data is synced back to the
server via a <strong>.NET JSON API</strong> which I also helped build.

## 2013:

### ISIS DMS

A client in the transport industry needed a smartphone-based delivery system
built as a compliment to their existing Warehouse Management System.

I was hired as a subcontractor to built the system - building the app in
<strong>HTML5 / Phonegap</strong> using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/isis-dms-load-list.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
</div>

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/isis-dms-drop-detail.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

The app captures data for each delivery, including the delivery signature
(<strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>), as well as location tracking - a custom
<strong>Phonegap plugin</strong> I wrote.

I also built the backend DMS system, which includs a <strong>JSON API</strong>
and <strong>Web Portal</strong> for tracking deliveries and viewing the
Proof of Delivery - all developed in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and deployed
on <strong>Heroku</strong>.

<div style="width:582px; height:377px; background-image:url(/assets/images/isis-dms-portal-load-details.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

Later, I was engaged to help implement the system for a number of customers,
including building interfaces between DMS and the customer's existing transport
system

## 2012:

### ARMS Infoscreens

A different client in the transport industry needed a web-based Customer Portal
built, so management could see KPIs, stats, etc on the current status of their
fleet.

<div style="width:610px; height:380px; background-image:url(/assets/images/arms-infoscreens-graphs.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

I was hired as a subcontractor, and built a Web Portal using
<strong>.NET MVC</strong> and <strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

The web portal took data from existing systems (delivery tracking systems,
runsheet management systems) and presented it as viewable information in the
portal - graphs, maps and tabular data were used to show key metrics,
end-customers could also login and view their deliveries, and location of their
truck.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2012:

### Endota Day Spa mobile website

I was hired by a design agency to build the Endota Day Spa mobile website,
working closely with their graphic designers.

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-detail.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block; margin-right: 20px;">
</div>

<div style="width:320px; height:548px; background-image:url(/assets/images/endota-spa-spa-booking.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

Using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>, I created a mobile website which allows users to
browse and search through Endota's spa locations and view location-specific
services and offers.

Menus for each location can be viewed, as well users can make bookings through
a mobile form.

## 2011:

### Guitar Charts Creator

I built Guitar Charts Creator for myself, as it was a tool I had been wanting
for a while on my tablet.

GCC is a tool for guitarists, allowing them to create their own chord charts,
designed initially for the iPad and available on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id497942050?mt=8">iOS App Store</a>.

<div style="width:640px; height:468px; background-image:url(/assets/images/guitar-charts-creator-edit-chart.png); background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size:100%; display:inline-block;">
</div>

I built the app in HTML5 using <strong>jQuery Mobile</strong> and
<strong>Backbone.js</strong>.

Later, I ported GCC so it could run as a
<a href="http://www.guitarchartscreator.com">stand-alone traditional web app</a>
(via <strong>Heroku</strong>), as well as porting it to <strong>OSX</strong>
via the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/guitar-charts-creator/id689856499?mt=12">Mac App Store</a>
(using <strong>Phonegap</strong>).

All versions of GCC use <strong>Parse.com</strong> as a backend "cloud"
database, allowing user data to be synced between any version of GCC.
