Looking to hire a freelance developer?

You've come to the right place then! I may be available at the moment and would
<a href="mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=hello">love to hear from you</a>.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## About myself:

I'm a freelance web &amp; software developer, servicing the Melbourne area.

I've been working as a programmer for over 10 years, completing projects in a
multitude of industries (energy, transport, digital design to name a few).

I've experienced all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from
**gathering requirements**, **analysis and design** - through to **building**, **testing**,
**deploying** and **supporting** software systems.

I have the experience to help make your next software project a successful one.

## Why hire a freelancer?

There are some significant advantages in hiring a freelance programmer for your
next project:

 * Freelancers are a great way to get an additional resource for a particular
   project, without the on-going costs of full-time employees. When the project
   is over, or you need to scale back on resources, you're not required to keep
   paying us - we only get paid when we're working for you.

 * Hiring full-time employees is expensive! You have to pay superannuation,
   payroll tax, annual & sick leave entitlements. It's a massive commitment.

   As a freelancer, you'll simply pay my rate during the times I'm working
   for you - this gives you a lot of flexibility in how you can resource your
   projects.

 * I provide my own equipment and tools (computer, software, etc) - you don't
   need to purchase these for me - this saves you a lot of money, as these can
   often be quite expensive.

 * Contractors are often flexible about what hours they work. I can do an
   urgent job for you at short notice, or I can change my working hours to suit
   your project (for example, if you were located in a different timezone).

 * We are also very accountable with our time - I log all of my time in a
   timesheet which I make available for my clients to view online. You will
   know exactly what I'm working on and where your money is being invested.

 * Freelancers are hard-working, professional people. Many of us have a great
   deal of experience that could be invaluable in making your next project a
   success.

## Skills and Experience

I've worked as a web developer for over 10 years, working with many
different technologies. I'm a good fit for many projects, as I have a breadth
of knowledge across many technology stacks, but are also pretty focused around
modern web development practices.

These days I tend to focus in a few key areas:

 *  **Mobile HTML5 development**. I've written several apps for
    clients utilizing the latest HTML5 technologies, to create cross-platform,
    native-feeling applications.

    Using Javascript frameworks like [Backbone.js][1] or [AngularJS][2], and
    wrapping the application in [Phonegap][3]/[Cordova][4] I've been able to
    deploy the same app to both iOS and Android devices - which is a big win
    for my clients who are looking to not write the same app multiple times.

    I use best practices for Javascript development, utilising tools like
    [Grunt][5], [Bower][6] and [Yeoman][7]. I'm a fan of [Ionic Framework][19]
    and [jQuery Mobile][8], using them to quickly build HTML5 mobile user
    interfaces.

 *  **Backend web development**. I've built many web apps over the years,
    in different backend technologies:

    * [Ruby on Rails][9]
    * [PHP][10] ([Zend Framework][18])
    * [ASP.NET MVC][11]

    These days I'm often writing RESTful web APIs to communcate with my mobile
    web applications.

    I have good database experience and have worked with [PostgreSQL][12],
    [MySQL][13], [Oracle][14], [SQL Server][15], [MongoDB][16] and
    [Parse.com][17] databases across various projects over the years.

If you have a project you would like me to work on, please do get in contact.

Cheers - hope to hear from you!
